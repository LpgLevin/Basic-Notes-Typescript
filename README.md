# Basic-Notes-Typescript

In this repo I have only worked in one file.
I have simply written a list of notes and examples explaining the basics of typescript in a way which makes sense to me that I can refer back to at any point.
These notes and examples are from watching the first 26 videos in the Udemy course **'React & TypeScript - The Practical Guide'** By Maximillian Schwartzemuller. https://www.udemy.com/course/react-typescript-the-practical-guide/
